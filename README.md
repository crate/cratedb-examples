## 👨‍💻 Usage

- You can explore the content by browsing folders within the repository.
  Main sections can be explored by using the quick links in the header
  area.

- If you are looking for something specific, please use GitHub search, for
  example, [searching for "jdbc"].

- You can use the code snippets for educational and knowledge base purposes,
  or as blueprints within your own projects.

- The repository is also used to support QA processes. Each example is
  designed to be invoked as an integration test case, accompanied by a
  corresponding CI validation job.

## 🏕️ Testing

In the same way as on CI, you can invoke the example programs easily on your
workstation, in order to quickly get started on behalf of working example code,
or to verify connectivity within your computing environment.

### Prerequisites

For invoking the software integration tests, you will need installations of
Docker, Python, and Git on your workstation.

Before running the tests, make sure to supply an instance of CrateDB. In order
to use and verify the most recent available code, let's select the OCI image
`crate/crate:nightly`.

```shell
docker run --rm -it --pull=always \
    --name=cratedb --publish=4200:4200 --publish=5432:5432 \
    --env=CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=4g \
    crate/crate:nightly -Cdiscovery.type=single-node
```

### Test Runner `ngr`

The repository uses a universal test runner to invoke test suites of
different languages and environments, called `ngr`.

In order to run specific sets of test cases, you do not need to leave
the top-level directory, or run any kind of environment setup procedures.
If all goes well, just select one of the folders of interest, and invoke
`ngr test` on it, like that:

    ngr test by-language/java-jdbc
    ngr test by-language/python-sqlalchemy
    ngr test by-language/php-amphp
    ngr test by-dataframe/dask
    ngr test application/apache-superset
    ngr test testing/testcontainers/java
    ngr test topic/machine-learning/llm-langchain

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to invoke `ngr` from within a Python virtualenv,
> in order to isolate its installation from the system Python.
> Installing `ngr` works like this:
> ```shell
> git clone https://github.com/crate/cratedb-examples
> cd cratedb-examples
> python3 -m venv .venv
> source .venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

### Test Matrix Support

Some examples optionally obtain parameters on invocation time.

One example is the test suite for Npgsql, which accepts the version number of
the Npgsql driver release to be obtained from the environment at runtime,
overriding any internally specified versions. Example:

    ngr test by-language/csharp-npgsql --npgsql-version=6.0.9

> [!TIP]
> This feature is handy if you are running a test matrix, which is
> responsible for driving the version numbers, instead of using the
> version numbers nailed within local specification files of any sort.
