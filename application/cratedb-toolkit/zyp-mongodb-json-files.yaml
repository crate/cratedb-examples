# A Zyp Transformation [1] file to support importing datasets
# from mongodb-json-files [2] into CrateDB [3].

# [2] https://github.com/ozlerhakan/mongodb-json-files
# [3] https://cratedb.com/docs/guide/feature/

# Because CrateDB can not store nested arrays into OBJECT(DYNAMIC) columns,
# this file defines a corresponding transformation to work around the problem.
#
# The workaround applied here is to just exclude/omit relevant `available_sizes`
# elements completely. Converting them right can be implemented on behalf of a
# later iteration.

# "image": {
#   "available_sizes": [
#     [
#       [
#         150,
#         99
#       ],
#       "assets/images/resized/0001/3896/13896v3-max-150x150.jpg"
#     ],
#   ]
#
# A possible representation could be:
#
# "image": {
#   "available_sizes": [
#     {
#       "path": "assets/images/resized/0001/3896/13896v3-max-150x150.jpg",
#       "size": {"width": 150, "height": 99},
#     }
#   ]
# }
