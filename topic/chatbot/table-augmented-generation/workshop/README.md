# Timeseries QA with LLMs

*Combine Telemetry Data and Manuals for Smarter Diagnostics.*

---

## Summary

In this hands-on workshop, participants will build an AI-powered assistant that can answer questions using a combination of **timeseries telemetry data** and **structured machine manuals**. 

Using **CrateDB** as a scalable time-series database and **OpenAI's large language models**, attendees will walk through how to:
- Simulate telemetry data
- Store and query with SQL
- Convert natural language into structured SQL queries
- Integrate external context (like manuals)
- Generate explanations and visualizations based on live data

This workshop combines **Table-Augmented Generation (TAG)** with best practices in prompt design, data enrichment, and telemetry monitoring ‚Äî creating an interactive diagnostics assistant from scratch.

By the end of the session, participants will have a working QA system capable of answering both technical and operational questions in natural language, using real telemetry data and contextual documentation.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand how to build a **TAG (Table-Augmented Generation)** assistant using structured data and manuals
- Learn how to simulate, store, and analyze **timeseries data** in **CrateDB**
- Master prompt engineering techniques to guide LLMs in generating accurate SQL queries
- Combine telemetry results with structured documentation (manuals) to generate full-context answers
- Create **visualizations** from natural-language queries using **Matplotlib and Plotly**
- Explore how LLMs can reason across structured (CrateDB) and unstructured (manuals) sources

---

## Requirements from Attendees

- **Laptop + Charger** (for running Jupyter notebooks)
- **Python Basics** (e.g. working with pandas, functions, etc.)
- **Basic SQL Knowledge** (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY‚Ä¶)
- **OpenAI API Key** (required for accessing GPT)

---

## Maturity Level

**Intermediate**  
This workshop is ideal for developers, data engineers, solution architects, and tech leads who have some experience with Python and data querying. No deep ML background is needed ‚Äî the focus is practical application.

---

## Type of Workshop

**Hands-On Lab**  
Participants will interactively build, run, and modify a full-stack LLM-powered assistant. Exercises are incremental, exploratory, and designed for real-world relevance.
