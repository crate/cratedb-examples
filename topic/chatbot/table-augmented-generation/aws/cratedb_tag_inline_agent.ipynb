    "- ‚úÖ **Detect anomalies** using both data and manual thresholds\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Interpret machine behavior** by combining real-time metrics with context from manuals\n",

    "- Set up your environment and connected to CrateDB, a powerful distributed SQL database optimized for timeseries data.\n",
    "- Generated and loaded synthetic telemetry data simulating real-world sensor readings from industrial machines.\n",
    "- Built a natural language interface with an LLM to convert plain English into CrateDB-compatible SQL queries.\n",
    "- Visualized time-series data directly from natural language questions, bringing clarity to trends, outliers, and anomalies.\n",
    "- Defined an inline AI agent, communicating with CrateDB through an MCP server.\n",
    "- Generated structured machine manuals, complete with thresholds, anomaly rules, and emergency procedures.\n",
