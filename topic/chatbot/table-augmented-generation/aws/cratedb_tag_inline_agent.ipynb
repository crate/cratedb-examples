    "# 🛠️ Timeseries QA with agentic LLMs & manuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this **hands-on workshop** where we explore how to combine **LLMs (Large Language Models)** with **machine telemetry data** and **equipment manuals** for smart diagnostics. With the help of an **AI agent** we will talk to our data in natural language.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Workshop Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this session, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Query timeseries data** using natural language\n",
    "- ✅ **Detect anomalies** using both data and manual thresholds\n",
    "- ✅ **Interpret machine behavior** by combining real-time metrics with context from manuals\n",
    "- ✅ **Generate SQL and visualizations** with the help of an LLM\n",
    "- ✅ **Explain telemetry results** in plain English\n",
    "- ✅ **Define an AI agent** and understand its basic building blocks such as model context protocol (MCP) servers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern machines generate a huge volume of telemetry data (vibration, temperature, speed, etc.). Understanding this data is critical for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🛑 **Detecting anomalies before they cause failures**\n",
    "- 🔍 **Explaining why something is behaving abnormally**\n",
    "- 🧰 **Making maintenance more proactive and data-driven**\n",
    "\n",
    "But reading raw data isn't enough...\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why this notebook shows how **AI assistants can help domain experts and analysts** by combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 **Telemetry data** (from CrateDB)\n",
    "- 📘 **Manuals and expert context** (stored in SQL)\n",
    "- 💬 **Natural language** (as the interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this workshop, you'll create a system that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load and explore machine telemetry stored in CrateDB\n",
    "- Ask questions like:\n",
    "  - _“Is machine 5 overheating?”_\n",
    "  - _“What should I do if machine 3 has an anomaly?”_\n",
    "- Generate relevant SQL queries, tapping into the large number of LLMs available on AWS Bedrock\n",
    "- Use an MCP server in connection with an agent, to make the smart assistant extendable with other services\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this will run **in a single Jupyter notebook** — no frontend or backend code needed.\n",

    "- Set up your environment and connected to CrateDB, a powerful distributed SQL database optimized for timeseries data.\n",
    "- Generated and loaded synthetic telemetry data simulating real-world sensor readings from industrial machines.\n",
    "- Built a natural language interface with an LLM to convert plain English into CrateDB-compatible SQL queries.\n",
    "- Visualized time-series data directly from natural language questions, bringing clarity to trends, outliers, and anomalies.\n",
    "- Defined an inline AI agent, communicating with CrateDB through an MCP server.\n",
    "- Generated structured machine manuals, complete with thresholds, anomaly rules, and emergency procedures.\n",
    "- Merged telemetry with manual context, allowing a single question to yield data-driven insights and operational guidance.\n",
