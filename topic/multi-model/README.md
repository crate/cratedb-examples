# CrateDB UK Offshore Wind Farms Data Workshop

This workshop explores multi-model data modeling and queries with [CrateDB](https://cratedb.com), using data from [The Crown Estate](https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/marine/offshore-wind) which manages the UK's offshore wind farms.  It is derived from a conference presentation that you can [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqiLGjaTlBk).

Use the Jupyter notebook to run the queries from the talk yourself, in your own CrateDB cluster in the cloud... click the button below to try it out in Google Colab!
