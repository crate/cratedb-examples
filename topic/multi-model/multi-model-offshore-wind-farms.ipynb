It is derived from a conference presentation that you can [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqiLGjaTlBk).\n",

    "You'll work with tables containing data for:\n",

    "* **Wind Farms**.  Details of the UK's 45 offshore wind farms are loaded into a CrateDB table from the supplied JSONL file.  Each record includes an ID for the wind farm as well as a name, description and geospatial data in [WKT format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) that describes the shape of the wind farm as one or more polygons.  The co-ordinates of each turbine are also included, where known.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hourly Wind Farm Performance Data**.  This table contains time-series data pertaining to the power output of each wind farm on an hourly basis for the period 19th August 2024 to 28th October 2024.  The data is supplied as a compressed JSONL file.\n",

The initial proposal was for an installed capacity of 1200 MW. Cabling for East Anglia ONE lands near the River Deben at Bawdsey, runs north of Ipswich and is connected to the National Grid at Bramford. A plan was formally submitted to the government in December 2012, and planning consent was granted in June 2014. In October 2014 ScottishPower announced that it intended to scale down East Anglia ONE because of insufficient subsidies. In February 2015 it was announced that ScottishPower would proceed with a scaled-down 714 MW project. A contract for £119/MWh was published on 27 April 2016, using 102 Siemens Wind Power direct-drive 7 MW turbines. Nacelles were built in Cuxhaven, while blades were made in Hull. Due to water depths between 30-40m, the turbines use jacketed foundations. Cabling is at 66 kV as opposed to the traditional 33 kV. Two export cables at 220 kV AC send the power to shore. A support vessel is powered by used vegetable oil.</td>\n",

The wind farm received consent in 2014, and received support under the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme at £57.50/MWh (2012 prices) in 2017. The wind farm began exporting power in June 2021. The final turbine was installed in September 2021. Full power output was achieved in April 2022 and was commissioned.

       "      <td>Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm is a Round 2 wind farm in North Sea off the coast of Norfolk. A lease for use of the sea bed was obtained in 2004 by Scira Offshore Energy (later acquired by Statoil (now Equinor) and Statkraft), the development gained offshore planning consent in 2008, and was constructed 2009–2011, being officially opened in 2012. The wind farm has 88 Siemens Wind Power 3.6MW turbines (total power 316.8 MW) spread over a 35 km2 (14 sq mi) area over 17 km (11 mi) from shore. In 2004 the Crown Estate awarded Econventures (Utrecht, NL) the lease of the Round 2 wind farm site at Sheringham shoal. Econventures together with SLP Energy (Lowestoft, UK) formed a joint venture Scira Offshore Energy to develop a c. 315MW wind farm. Development work for Econventures was to be carried out by Evelop BV, both subsidiaries of Econcern BV. In 2005 Hydro took a 50% stake in Scira, acquiring 25% shareholdings from both SLP Energy and Ecocentures. In 2006 Scira submitted a planning application to the Department of Trade and Industry for a 108 turbine, 315 MW wind farm. The planned wind farm was approximately 18 kilometres (11 mi) off the coast of Norfolk at Sheringham, just within the 12 nm UK territorial water boundary, and 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north of the sand bank known as Sheringham shoal. The wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 metres (52 to 72 ft) and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines. Benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities; lack of any dredging, dumping, oil/gas, or MoD practice areas, and of cables or pipelines; as well as low visual impact from the coast, and outside any nature conservation areas. The seabed at the wind farm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand, overlying chalk. The electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near Muckleburgh Collection, via landfall near Weybourne Hope. Two routes were considered for the export cable, one avoiding the sandbank at Sheringham shoal. The connection to the National Grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near Salle, Norfolk via a 132kV 21.3 kilometres (13.2 mi) underground cable. Planning consent for the wind farm was given on 8 August 2008.</td>\n",
