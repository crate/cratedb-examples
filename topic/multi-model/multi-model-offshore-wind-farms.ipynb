It is derived from a conference presentation that you can [watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqiLGjaTlBk).\n",

    "You'll work with tables containing data for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wind Farms**.  Details of the UK's 45 offshore wind farms are loaded into a CrateDB table from the supplied JSONL file.  Each record includes an ID for the wind farm as well as a name, description and geospatial data in [WKT format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) that describes the shape of the wind farm as one or more polygons.  The co-ordinates of each turbine are also included, where known.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hourly Wind Farm Performance Data**.  This table contains time-series data pertaining to the power output of each wind farm on an hourly basis for the period 19th August 2024 to 28th October 2024.  The data is supplied as a compressed JSONL file.\n",
