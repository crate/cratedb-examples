The vector representation of this data is stored in its own column named `description_vec` which uses CrateDB's [`FLOAT_VECTOR`](https://cratedb.com/docs/crate/reference/en/latest/general/ddl/data-types.html#float-vector) type.  \n",

    "There are two columns used to store geospatial data.  `location` is a `GEO_POINT`, storing a single latitude/longitude position representing the location of the wind farm.  `boundaries` is a `GEO_SHAPE` column that stores the GeoJSON representation of the overall shape of the wind farm's boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "CrateDB supports nested object columns in tables and these can have dynamic schemas.  In this case, we already know what the schema for our `turbines` object looks like, so we specify it when creating the table.  Note that object columns can contain other \"container\" data types - in this case we have an array for the geospatial data about the location of each turbine in the wind farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on to the `windfarm_output` table... this data is more of a time series, and the table schema for it reflects this.  Data is received hourly from each wind farm, and is stored against the ID of the wind farm and a timestamp.  To help with aggregations and managing rolling data windows, we have CrateDB generate a couple of extra columns for values that aren't in the source data: `month` and `day`.  We also partition the table by day to assist with managing the data and speed up aggregations.
